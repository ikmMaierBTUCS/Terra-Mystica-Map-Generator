# Terra-Mystica-Map-Generator
In 'Examples of generated maps.png', there are 12 maps randomly generated by an algorithm that i have developed, playtested and improved in the recent 2 months. it uses an approach where the probability of a hex becoming green (or another color) is the higher the farer away - based on a measure of how many ships/spades are required - the next green hex is. rivers have to be predefined. 

the algorithm can also be used to heavily facilitate creating actual maps out of just ideas. just define the river layout, and run the algo to produce 10 maps with that layout. then pick the map version you like best and maybe make minor changes if necessary.

Run the code in TM MapGen(1).py by executing the following commands:

1 Create a colorless map for given river layout with parameters (height, width, form, rivers)

you can also copy the layout of some well-known maps: original, F&I, fjords, loon lakes, archipelago and arrow

hex_map = HexagonalMap(height, width, form, rivers)

2 fill the map with colors

hex_map.create_map()

3 print the finished map as a string suitable for BGA format map-files

print(hex_map.bga_format())

#4 print a colored preview of the map

if __name__ == '__main__':
    plot_map()
